   First news, I use subversion now and the address of tyhe server is now : http://gmysqlcc.thepozer.org/svn. Look on EnInstall to see how to get source with subversion.
   I will stop the cvs server in few days.
   Second news, I have changed of domain, now it's http://gmysqlcc.thepozer.org/ ... And I have changed of site : I use Trac to give you a subversion source browser and a simple bug tracker with the ticket system.
   New version (Version : 0.2.4) 
   I have added a system to execute SQL file directly and corrected some small problems.

   New version (Version : 0.2.3) 
   I have rewrote all internal dump code ... Now you can really dump in SQL/CSV/XML from a Server/Database/Table/Query.
   I have ortogonalized GUI code, add a button to show and hide edit part in the server list window and some few other modifications ...
   I have added 2 flags in in the server management : read only and warning. With these flags, you can deny any data update on a server or simply warn you when try to update datas.
   Last point, I have changed the hostname of the cvs server ... now it's cvs.thepozer.org ... look to the install part.

   Less than 1 month between 2 versions, it's great ... :) (Version : 0.2.0) 
   Gmysqlcc use configure now, so the compilation method has changed. I have modified dump system, Now it write datas directly to the disk, not store them in memory ...
