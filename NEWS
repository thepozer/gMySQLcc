	Less than 1 month between 2 versions, it's great ...  :) (Version : 0.2.0)
	Gmysqlcc use configure now, so the compilation method has changed.
	I have modified dump system, Now it write datas directly to the disk, not store them in memory ...
	I have also corrected a small bug in the structure dump (bad tables name).
	You can dump data in SQL or CVS, XML format will come soon.
	Another corrected bug, you can see and edit values with accents or other things. I do a convertion into server charset for each query ...
